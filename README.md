# Introduction
Hi, I’m Prem Chand Serawat, an experienced Software Engineer and Data Scientist passionate about leveraging technology to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly software solutions. With over 5 years in the industry, I specialize in SaaS product development, focusing both on the intricate details of frontend and the complexities of backend systems.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer II at QuillBot IT Solution Pvt. Ltd. During my tenure, I've been deeply involved in enhancing code quality, developing seamless user experiences, and architecting robust data pipelines. Some of my notable projects include creating a CMS from scratch, developing a paraphrasing tool, a grammar checker, and a citation generator. I also led critical big data processing initiatives, managing and optimizing the processing of over 160 million JSON records into Elasticsearch, substantially reducing computational resources by 95%.

Before QuillBot, I worked as a Junior Software Engineer at Ascend Capital, where I was responsible for developing web and mobile applications to streamline the loan origination and management process for financial institutions.

I hold a B.Tech in Information Technology from Govt. Engineering College Bikaner, completed in 2019. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and Java. I’m adept at web development frameworks like Node.js, React.js, Next.js, Redux, VueJS, NuxtJS, and NestJS. On the backend, I’m proficient with databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Apache Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and Open Search.

My expertise extends into big data technologies, including Apache Beam, GCP Dataflow, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, and Kafka. For data visualization, I regularly use tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Power BI. I’ve also done extensive web scraping using Puppeteer, node-html-parser, Beautiful Soup, and PySelenium.

In the realm of cloud computing and DevOps, I'm experienced with GCP, Azure, CI/CD pipelines, and Docker. Additionally, I've developed cross-platform mobile applications using React Native.

My journey in tech has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and innovation. I love diving into new challenges, optimizing performance, and consistently delivering high-quality solutions. Whether it's working on a scalable web application or architecting a complex data pipeline, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in software engineering and data science.
